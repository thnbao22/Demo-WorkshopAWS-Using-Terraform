# Demo-WorkshopAWS-Using-Terraform

I will build infrastructure based on this workshop which I have made to submit to mission 1 of my First Cloud Journey Program.
- Link to the workshop: [Workshop](https://thnbao22.github.io/)

- Some AWS services I use in this workshop include VPC, EC2, S3, and Gateway Endpoint that supports private connection to S3 Bucket.

- Architecture:

- So I have completely done coding infrastructure for the architecture in the workshop.
- I will soon complete the demo of this project.

# Demo
